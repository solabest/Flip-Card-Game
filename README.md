This code creates a memory card game where players need to match pairs of cards with identical images. Each card has a front and back face, and when clicked, it flips to reveal its content. The game includes cards with different frameworks (such as Aurelia, Vue, Angular, Ember, Backbone, and React), each represented by a unique image.

Players flip two cards at a time, attempting to remember the positions of cards with matching frameworks. If the two flipped cards have matching frameworks, they remain visible; otherwise, they flip back over after a short delay. The game ends when all pairs are successfully matched.
